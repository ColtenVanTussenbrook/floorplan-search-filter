This is a WordPress plugin I built for a client. They needed an advanced search filter that would allow a user to filter houseplans based on square footage, width, etc. 
The plugin is written in PHP and HTML, and uses a little JavaScript for some front end functionatliy. This was the first WordPress plugin I built start to finish.

This plugin is pretty simple. There are 6 files. floorplan-search-plugin.php is the main plugin file, and there's a file for the HTML output, a file for the search filter logic, a file for custom taxonomies, and one for displaying the plugin as a widget.

Feel free to use this code and make any changes you want. Like I said, this is my first plugin so I'm aware there could be some code that could be improved. I have however taken security into account and I've had a WordPress pro go through and verify it's secure.
